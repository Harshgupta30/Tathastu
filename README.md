Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures and Voice Commands. The computer requires almost no direct contact. All i/o operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures along with a voice assistant. This project makes use of the state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures and voice commands, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirements. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) running on top of pybind11. It consists of two modules: One which works direct on hands by making use of MediaPipe Hand detection, and other which makes use of Gloves of any uniform color. Currently it works on Windows platform.
